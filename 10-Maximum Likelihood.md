# Maximum Likelihood

## The theory

Maximum Likelihood is a statistical method, based on the calculation of probabilities. Namely, it calculates the probability of getting the data matrix ( $D$ ) given a determinate hypothesis ( $H$: the tree and the nucleotide substitution model). In other words: which is the probability of, having obtained a determinate tree, this will be the result of analysing our data? In mathematical language: $P(D|H)$.

We must be aware that the likelihood is not the probability of that our tree will be absolutely correct, but that it corresponds to our data.
